# Portfolio


## Description

The purpose of this project was to build a portfolio so that employers in the future can examine my work and determine whether or not I will be a good fit for their company. While completing this project, I furthered my knowledge of HTML and Advanced CSS. I spent a lot of time manipulating the wide variety of visual aspects in my portfolio. 

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
