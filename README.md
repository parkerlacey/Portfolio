# Portfolio


## Description

The purpose of this project was to build a portfolio so that employers in the future can examine my work and determine whether or not I will be a good fit for their company. While completing this project, I furthered my knowledge of HTML and Advanced CSS. I spent a lot of time manipulating the wide variety of visual aspects in my portfolio.
